# Process

## Development

This project was managed through Trello, as well as GitHub PRs and multiple coexisting branches. As we developed more ideas and concepts for our application, we would create cards in our Trello board, and each week, move cards that we wanted to work on into a column representing ongoing tasks. Once each task was finished, we created pull requests on GitHub to standardize code review and merging. Then, the cards on Trello would be moved into a column representing finished tasks. 

## Testing

Code was tested through a series of unit tests, for helpers, POROs, and models. These tests were created as we developed, to shape our understanding of our code and the specs we wanted to implement. Although we never turned this into CI/CD for our application on GitHub, that is a future expansion we would like to add on.

## Deployment

Our application is currently deployed [Heroku](http://www.coinexpanse.com). Deployment was done after the end of each major sprint, in order to demonstrate weekly/biweekly progress on our application.
