This application centers on a user interface that allows users to manage their crypto trading
in a flexible format. You're able to participate in paper trading (simulated crypto trading)
as well as actual trading. This is a flexible graphical user interface, meaning that users will
not only be able to customize their own widgets for displaying trading data, but create their own
widgets that consist of a set of existing widgets, helping the user customize their experience
with crypto trading. This is comparable to programs like Scratch, a basic programming interface,
which have drag-and-drop components that allow users to construct something more complex.
Block Trade has that direct functionality, as well as a means for you to upload your
own Ruby code for more customized widgets or displays, and save them to a marketplace for
other users to take advantage of. It's linked to your personal trading account via
Binance US.
